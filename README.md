### Hello Everyone, My Self
# Ankul Raja Patel

This Ankul Answer Website is come up to a very unique idea. In this, we are not buying or selling any product. But this is unique and we use this website to play with our friend circle.

Basically, in this, we ask the question by writing in the Question input and write petition as "Ankul please give answer the following question".

After clicking the Ask Button, we find an answer to the question. The question should be generic and related to your life also. You will find the answer to all questions of your personal life. [Know How to play](#rule).

In the place of Question, you can type any question which you want to ask. But,

In the place of the petition, if you use a `.` (dot) first, then write the answer to the question, a predefined petition (i.e., "Ankul Please Answer The Following Question") is shown in the petition row so your friend will not understand what you are writing üòÅ.
